# Zelda Majora’s Mask (NTSC) - Decompilation Attempt

This isn’t an official or serious decompilation of Zelda majora’s mask. If you’re looking for an actual decompilation, see ZeldaRET.

I never tried decompiling something before, it’s my first attempt. I’m using Ghidra and Project64 as a debugger. I am neither good nor bad at programming, but i can make some stuff i guess. I’m really bad with MIPS tho (i’m learning it while decompiling the game).

I'm using my own dumped rom of the game.

If you somehow found my project and want to help me a bit, then don’t hesitate to reach out.
